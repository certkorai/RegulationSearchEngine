Links vary greatly depending on the specific department and publication.] | 1. Define Scope: Determine the AI system's purpose, functions, and data inputs. 2. Identify Stakeholders: Consult with relevant individuals and groups affected by the system. 3. Assess Potential Impacts: Analyze how the system might impact different demographic groups. 4. Identify Bias Risks: Look for potential biases in data, algorithms, or decision-making processes. 5. Develop Mitigation Strategies: Propose ways to reduce or eliminate identified bias risks. 6. Document Findings: Create a report summarizing the assessment and proposed mitigation strategies. 7. Implement and Monitor:  Track the effects of the mitigation strategies and revise as needed. |  No single prescribed tool.  A combination of tools for data analysis, risk assessment, and project management may be used. |  Specific examples would need to come from case studies of completed impact assessments within government departments which are not routinely made public. | Securely store and manage all documentation related to the assessment. Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access. |
