Introduction  
 #AIforAll: Technology Leadership for Inclusive Growth  
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to disrupt our world. With intelligent machines enabling high -level 
cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making, coupled 
with advances in data collection and aggregation, analytics and compute r processing power, AI presents 
opportunities to complement and supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and 
work.  
India, being the fastest growing economy with the second largest population in the world, has a significant 
stake in the AI revolution. Recognising AI’s potential to transform economies and the need for India to 
strategise its approach, Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his budget speech  for 2018 – 2019 , mandated NITI 
Aayog to establish the National Program on AI , with a view to guiding the research and development in 
new and emerging technologies. In pursuance of the above, NITI Aayog has ad opted a three -pronged 
approach – undertaking exploratory proof -of-concept AI projects in various areas, crafting a national 
strategy for buil ding a vibrant AI ecosystem in India and collaborating with various experts and 
stakeholders. Since the start of this year, NITI Aayog has partnered with several leading AI technology 
players to implement AI projects in critical areas such as agriculture a nd health. Learnings from these 
projects, under various stages of implementation, as well as our engagement with some of the leading 
institutions and experts have given a better perspective to our task of crafting the national strategy for AI , 
which is the  focus of this discussion paper.  
This strategy document is premised on the proposition that India, given its strengths and characteristics, 
has the potential to position itself among leader s on the global AI map – with a  unique brand of #AIforAll . 
The appr oach in this paper focuses on how India can leverage the transformative technologies to ensure 
social and inclusive growth in line with the development philosophy of the government. In addition, India 
should  strive to replicate these solutions in other sim ilarly placed developing countries .  
#AIforAll will aim at enhancing and empowering human capabilities to address the challenges of access, 
affordability, shortage and inconsistency of skilled expertise; effective implementation of AI initiatives to 
evolve  scalable s olutions for emerging economies;  and endeavors to tackle some of the global challenges 
from AI’s perspective, be it application, research, development,  technology, or responsible AI. #AIforAll 
will focus on harnessing collaborations and partners hips, and aspires to ensure prosperity for all. Thus, 
#AIforAll means technology leadership in AI for achieving the greater good.  
While evolving the national strategy for AI, the underlying thrust was to identify applications with maximum 
social impact,  a willingness to learn from the best of the world when it comes to the recen t technology 
advancements in AI,  and leveraging approaches that democrati ze access to and further development of 
AI. 
From an applications perspective, the approach is to identify sec tors that may have the potential of 
greatest externalities while adopting AI solutions, and hence require the government to play a leading 
role in developing the implementation roadmap for AI. For example, the agriculture sector in India, which 
forms the b edrock of India’s economy, needs multi -layered technology infusion and coordination amongst 
several stakeholders. Efforts from private sector may neither be financially optimal nor efficient on a 
standalone basis, and hence  sustained government interventio n to tackle the existing challenges  and 
constraints  is needed . Hence, India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimi sation 
of social goods, rather than maximis ation of topline growth.   
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

From a technology perspective, the strategy is to maximi se the late -movers’ advantage. Acknowledging 
that India is some distance away from consistently delivering home grown pioneering technology 
solutions in AI, adapting and innovating the technology for India’s unique needs and opportunities would 
help it in leap frogging, while simultaneously building the foundational R&D capability aimed at ensuring 
competitiveness in the long run.  
Solving for India, given the complexity and multi -dimensional aspects of most of our economic and 
societal challenges, can  easily be extended to the rest of the emerging and developing economies. An 
integral part of India’s strategy for AI involves tackling common and complex global challenges that can 
be solved through technology intervention, and India’s scale and opportuni ty landscape provides the ideal 
test-bed to ensure sustainable and scalable solutions . 
The purpose of this paper is to lay the ground work for evolv ing the National Strategy for Artificial 
Intelligence . While this paper includes several recommendations, so me of which may be deemed 
disruptive, specifics (e.g. execution and financial implications) have been consciously avoided, since 
wider consultations and consensus building is needed to refine these recommendations. This document 
is intended to serve as an “essential pre -read” in building a truly transformative approach in pursuit of 
#AIforAll.

Executive S ummary  
 India’s Approach to L eadership in AI  
 
AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem 
solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI 
has evolved in ways that far exceed its orig inal conception. With incredible advances made in data 
collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a 
variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. As AI’s capabilities have dramatical ly 
expanded, so have  its utility in a growing number of fields.  
The truly transformative nature of the technology, yet the nascent stage of its adoption worldwide, 
provides India with an opportunity to define its own brand of AI leadership. #AIforAll - the brand proposed 
for India implies inclusive technology leadership, where the full potential of AI is reali sed in pursuance of 
the country’s unique needs and aspirations. The strategy should strive to leverage AI for economic 
growth, social development and inclusive growth, and finally as a “Garage” for emerging and developing 
economies.  
While AI has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors, adoption till date 
has been driven primarily from a commercial perspective . Technol ogy disruptions like AI are once -in-a-
generation phenomenon, and hence large -scale  adoption strategies, especially national strategies, need 
to strike a balance between narrow definitions of financial impact and the greater good. NITI Aayog has 
decided to focus on five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs : 
a) Healthcare: increased access and affo rdability of quality healthcare,  
b) Agriculture: enhanced farmers’ income, increased farm produc tivity and reduction of wasta ge, 
c) Education: improved access and quality of education,  
d) Smart Cities and Infrastructure: efficient and connectivity for the burgeoning urban population,  
and 
e) Smart Mobility and Transportation: smarter and safer modes of transportation and better traffic 
and congestion problems.  
To truly reap the benefits of deploying AI at scale, the report identifies the following barriers that need to 
be addressed in order to achieve the goals of #AIforAll:  
a) Lack of broad based expertise in research and application of AI,  
b) Absence of enabling data ecosystems – access to intelligen t data,  
c) High resource cost and l ow awareness for adoption of AI,  
d) Privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulatio ns around anonymis ation of data,  and 
e) Absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.  
Superior research capabilities have  been the cornerstone of leadership aspirations in emerging 
technologies and effectively realis ing the growth potential requires expertise in both core and applied 
research. Despite indicat ions of recent positive efforts in this aspect of technology, AI research in India 
is still in its infancy and requires large scale concerted and collaborative interventions .  
The paper proposes a two -tiered structure to address India’s AI research aspirat ions:  
a) Centre  of Research Excellence (CORE)  focused on developing better understanding of existing 
core research and pushing technology frontiers through creation of new knowledge;  
b) International Centers of Transformational AI (ICTAI)  with a mandate of developing and deploying 
application -based research. Private sector collaboration is envisioned to be a key aspect of 
ICTAIs.   
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

The research capabilities are proposed to be com plemented by an umbrella organis ation responsible for 
providing  direction to research efforts through analysis of socio -economic indicators, studying global 
advancements, and encouraging international collaboration. Pursuing “ moonshot research projects ” 
through speciali sed teams, development of a dedicated supranation al agency to channel research in 
solving big, audacious  problems of AI – “CERN for AI”, and developing common computing and other 
related infrastructure for AI are other key components research suggested .  
As technology increasingly disrupts the nature of jobs and shifts the benchmarks of technological 
aptitude, skilling and reskilling of workforce forms an integral part of our approach to adopting AI. There 
is an emergent need for reskilling the existing workforce and developing future talent in accordance  with 
the changing needs of the job market. This could be done via the adoption of decentrali sed teaching 
mechanisms working in collaboration with the private sector and educational institutions to prescribe 
certification with value. Furthermore, promotion  of job creation in new areas, like data annotation needs 
to be identified and promoted, as these would have the potential of absorbing a large portion of the 
workforce that may find itself redundant due to increasing automation.  
Adoption of AI across the  value chain viz. startups, private sector, PSUs and government entities, will 
truly unlock the potential by creating a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. The barriers to AI 
development and deployment can effectively be addressed by adopting the marketpl ace model – one 
that enables market discovery of not only the price but also of different approaches that are best suited 
to achieve the desired results. A three -pronged, formal marketplace could be created focusing on data 
collection and aggregation, data  annotation and deployable models. There could be a common platform 
called the National AI Marketplace (NAIM).  
Furthermore, for accelerated adoption of a highly collaborative technology like AI, the government has to 
play the critical role of a catalyst in  supporting partnerships, providing access to infrastructure, fostering 
innovation through research and creating the demand by seeking solutions for addressing various 
governmental  needs . 
As AI -based solutions permeate the way we live and do business, questions on ethics , privacy and 
security  will also emerge . Most discussions on ethical considerations of AI are a derivation of the FAT 
framework (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency). A consortium of Ethics Councils at each Centre  
of Research Excel lence can be set up and it would be expected that all COREs adhere to standard 
practice while developing AI technology and products.  
Data is one of the primary drivers of AI solutions, and thus appropriate handling of data, ensuring privacy 
and security is  of prime importance. Challenges include data usage without consent, risk of identification 
of individuals through data, data selection bias and the resulting discrimination of AI models, and 
asymmetry in data aggregation. The paper suggests establishing d ata protection frameworks and 
sectorial regulatory frameworks, and promotion of adopti on of international standards.  
In order for India to ride the AI innovation wave, a robust intellectual property framework is required. 
Despite a number of government in itiatives in strengthening the IP regime, challenges remain, especially 
in respect of applying stringent and narrowly focused patent laws to AI applications – given the unique 
nature of AI solution development. The importance of data to development of usef ul models is one such 
example. To tackle these issues, establishment of IP facilitation centers to help bridge the gap between 
practitioners and AI developers, and adequate training of IP granting authorities, judiciary and tribunals 
is suggested.  
The AI s trategy is aimed at primarily guiding an inevitable wave of change for quicker and better impact. 
The AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving and taking societies into uncharted territory. For now, we can begin 
to ask some of the big questions that each society m ust answer for itself: are we ready to manage data 
ethically? How do we bridge the digital divide? Which innovations are worthy of public funds and  
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

partnerships? Bringing these questions into the open is the most important step in ensuring that AI 
advances  create a better society.  
There has been tremendous activity concerning AI policy in different countries over the past couple of 
years. Governments in USA, UK, France, Japan and China have released their policy and strategy papers 
relating to AI. In order to establish a leadership role, it is important for India to take the plunge and start 
by releasing a Strategy Paper to initiate the roll out of an ambitious programme that would ensure for 
India its rightful place in this transformational era.

 What is Artificial Intelligence?  
 A technical primer  
 
AI might just be the single largest technology revolution of our live times, with the potential to disrupt 
almost all aspects of human existence. Andrew Ng, Co -founder of Coursera and formerly head of Baidu 
AI Group  / Google Brain, compares the transformational impact of AI to that of electr icity 100 years back. 
With many industries aggressively investing in cognitive and AI solutions, global investments are forecast 
to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50 .1% to reach USD 57.6 billion in 20211. 
AI is not a new phenomenon, with mu ch of its theoretical and technological underpinning developed over 
the past 70 years by computer scientists such as Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. AI has 
already existed to some degree in many industries and governments. Now, thanks to virt ually unlimited 
computing power and the decreasing costs of data storage, we are on the cusp of the exponential age of 
AI as organis ations learn to unlock the value trapped in vast volumes of data.  
AI is a constellation of technologies that enable machines  to act with higher levels of intelligence and 
emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act. Thus, comput er vision and audio 
processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and 
speech. The nat ural language processing and inference engines can enable AI systems to analy se and 
understand the information collected. An AI system can also take action through technologies such as 
expert systems and inference engines or  undertak e actions in the physic al world . These  human 
capabilities are augmented  by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapt ing over time. AI 
systems are finding ever -wider application to supplement these capabilities across enterprises as they 
grow in sophistication.  
Irrespective of the type of AI being used, however, every application begins with large amounts of training 
data. In the past, this kind of performance was driven by rules -based data analytics programs, statistical 
regressions, and early “expert systems.” But the explosion of powerful de ep neural networks now gives 
AI something a mere program doesn’t have: the ability to do the unexpected.

AI technology has experienced a checkered history of waves of optimism followed by disappointment and  
periods of inertia, dubbed as “ AI winters ”. Each previous breakthrough has only ever partly lived up to 
the hype it generated, and none has managed to kick -start the technology into the mainstream .

a) Unlimited access to computing power : The worldwide public cloud services market is projected 
to grow 21.4% in 2018 to total USD186.4 billion, up from USD153.5 bi llion in 2017, according to 
Gartner, Inc. The access is amplified by rapid increase in computational power.   
b) Huge fall in cost of storing data : We are in an age where the hard drive cost per gigabyte of data 
has been falling exponentially, to the extent th at we are approaching near zero marginal cost for 
storin g data (down from USD500,000  a gigabyte in 1980 to 2 cents a gigabyte in 2017).  
c) Explosion in data that is digiti sed: As per IDC forecasts,  by 2025 , the global data sphere will grow 
to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes)2, or ten times the 16.1ZB of data generated in 2016. 
As Barry Smyth, Professor of Computer science at University College Dublin, says: "Data is to 
AI what food is to humans. " So, in a more digital world, the exponential growth of data is 
constantly feeding AI improvements . 
Consider, for example, the vastly increased processing power that comes from using Graphics 
Processing Units (GPUs) in place of Central Processing Units (C PUs). Google , in May 2017 , 
announced that its  Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) delivered  30-80 times higher performance -per-watt 
than contemporary CPUs and GPUs.  When you add the decreasing cost of storage to the mix, plus 
the exponential growth in data volume s, together with the emergence of open source platforms and 
frameworks, you have got a uniquely potent combination of technologies and capabilities. It all adds 
up to a very powerful foundation to give AI its critical mass for mainstream adoption . 
Box 1: Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
Machine Learning, a term coined by Artur Samuel in 1959, meant “the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed.” Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms to parse data and learn from it, 
and making a determination or prediction as a result. Instead of hand coding software libraries with well -
defined specific instructions for a particular task, the machine gets “trained” using large amounts of data 
and algorithms, and in turn gains the capability to per form specific tasks . 
“Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine L earning. Deep L earning was inspired by the 
structure and function of the brain, specifically the interconnecting of many neurons. Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANNs) are algorithms that are based on the biological structure of  the brain. In ANNs, there 
are ‘neurons’  which have discrete layers and connections to other “neurons”. Each layer picks out a 
specific feature to learn. It’s this layering that gives deep learning its name, dep th is created by using 
multiple layers as opposed to a single layer3.”

Appendix I: Artificial Intelligence Explained . 
AI gets categori sed in different ways and it may be useful to understand the various categories, their 
rationale and the implications.  
a) Weak AI vs. Strong AI : Weak AI describes "simulated" thinking. That is, a system which appears 
to behave intelligently, but doesn't have any kind of consciousness about what it's doing. For 
example, a chatbot might appear to hold a natural conversation, but it has no sense of who it is 
or why it's talking to you. Strong AI describes "actual" thinking.  That is, behaving intelligently, 
thinking as human does, with a conscious, subjective mind. For example, when two humans 
converse, they most likely know exactly who they are, what they're doing, and why.  
b) Narrow AI vs. General AI : Narrow AI describes an AI  that is limited to a single task or a set 
number of tasks. For example, the capabilities of IBM's Deep Blue, the chess playing computer 
that beat world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, were limited to playing chess. It wouldn't have 
been able to win a game  of tic -tac-toe - or even know how to play. General AI describes an AI 
which can be used to complete a wide range of tasks in a wide range of environments. As such, 
it's much closer to human intelligence.  
c) Superintelligence: The term "superintelligence" is often used to refer to general and strong AI at 
the point at which it surpasses human intelligence, if it ever does.  
While big strides have been made in Artificial Narrow Intelligence – algorithms that can process 
documents, drive vehicles or beat champion  chess players, no one has yet claimed the first production 
or development of General AI. The weight of expert opinion is that we are a long way off the emergence 
of General AI.

 Global Developments in Artificial Intelligence  
Benchmarking s elect countries  
 
Countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the potential economic and social 
benefits of developing and applying AI. For example, China and U.K. estimate that 26% an d 10% of their 
GDPs respectively in 2030 will be sourced from AI -related activities and businesses. There has been 
tremendous activity concerning AI policy positions and the development of an AI ecosystem in different 
countries over the last 18 to 24 month s – the US published its AI report in December 2016; France 
published the AI strategy in January 2017 followed by a detail ed policy document in March 2018 ; Japan 
released a document in March 2017; China published the AI strategy in July 2017; and U.K. rele ased its 
industrial strategy in November 2017.  
Infrastructural supply side interventions have been planned by various countries for creating a larger 
ecosystem of AI development. Creation of “data trusts”, rolling out of digital connectivity infrastructur e 
such as 5G / full fiber networks, common supercomputing facilities, fiscal incentives and creation of open 
source software libraries are some of the focus areas of various governments as committed in their 
strategy papers.  
In the area of core research i n AI and related technologies, universities and research institutions from the 
US, China and Japan have led the publication volume on AI research topics between 2010 and 2016. 
Universities in USA, primarily Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institu te of Technology and 
Stanford, took an early lead in AI research by offering new courses, establishing research facilities and 
instituting industry partnerships. Off late, Chinese universities, especi ally Peking and Tsinghua 
Universities have caught on to the race by utilising large scale public funding and extensive research 
partnerships with private companies.  
For building the future workforce for AI, countries are also significantly increasing the allocation of 
resources for Science, Technology, Enginee ring and M aths (STEM) talent development through 
investment in universities, mandating new courses (e.g., AI and law), and offering schemes to retrain 
people. For instance, U.K. has planned to build over 1,000 government supported PhD researchers by 
2025 a nd set up a Turing fellowship to support an initial cohort of AI fellows while China has launched a 
five-year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000 students working on AI technologies.  
Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have 
instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.) 
while China and Japan have allowed existing minist ries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral 
areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware 
about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments.  
National governments h ave significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as 
increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network 
and infrastructure and AI -related public procurements. China, USA, Franc e and Japan have committed 
significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption.  
These countries are also leveraging different combinations of public -private -academia to develop and 
promote AI. Development of technology parks, and connec ting large corporations with start ups and  
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  
 
17 
 
forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are 
some of the public -private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused.  
AI technology dev elopment and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies 
and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found  that by 2022, around 46%  of the workforce will be 
engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically 
changed skillsets4. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in 
place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain 
and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio -economic environment. Therefore, 
the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India.  
A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is pl aced in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy 
Review .

 Artificial  Intelligence  and India  
Identifying priority areas for India’s efforts in Artificial Intelligence  
 
A national AI strategy needs to be premised on a framework which is adapted to India’ s unique needs 
and aspirations, while at the same time, is capable of achieving the country’s full potential of leveraging 
AI developments. Such a framework could be seen as an aggregation of the following three distinct, yet 
inter-related components:  
a) Oppo rtunity : the economic impact of AI for India  
b) AI for Greater Good : social development and inclusive growth  
c) AI Garage for 40% of the world : solution provider of choice for the emerging and developing 
economies (ex -China) across the globe   
Opportunity: the economic impact of Artificial Intelligence for India  
AI is emerging as a new factor of production, augmenting the traditional factors of production viz. labor, 
capital and innovation and technological changes captured 
in total factor productivity. AI has the potential to overcome 
the physical limitations of capital and labour, and open up 
new sources of value and growth. From an economic impact 
perspective, AI has the potential to drive growth through 
enabling: (a) intelligent automation i.e. ability to au tomate 
complex physical world tasks that require adaptability and 
agility across industries, (b) labo ur and capital 
augmentation: enabling humans to focus on parts of their 
role that add the most value, complementing human 
capabilities and improving capita l efficiency, and (c) 
innovation diffusion i.e. propelling innovations as it diffuses through the economy. AI innovations in one 
sector will have positive consequences in another, as industry sectors are interdependent based on value 
chain. Economic value is expected to be created from the new goods, services and innovations that AI 
will enable.  
Accenture, in its recent AI research reports5, provides a framework for evaluating the economic impact 
of AI for select G20 countries and estimates AI to boost Indi a’s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage 
points by 2035.

AI for Greater Good: social development and inclusive growth  
Beyond just the headline numbers of economic impact, a disruptive technology such as AI needs to be 
seen from the perspective of the transformative impact it could have on the greater good – improving the 
quality of life and access of choice to a large section of the country. In that sense, the recent 
advancements in AI seem to be custom -made for the unique opportunities and challenges that India 
faces. Increased access to quality health facilities (including addressing the locational access barriers), 
inclusive financial growth for large sections of population that have hitherto been excluded  from formal 
financial products,  providing real -time advisory to farmers and help address unforeseen factors towards 
increasing productivity, building smart and efficient cities and infrastructure to meet the demands of 
rapidly urbani sing population are some of the examples that can be most effectively solved through the 
non-incremental advantages that a technology such as AI can provide . 
AI Garage for 40% of the world  
In addition to providing unique opportuni ties, India provides a per fect “ playground ” for enterprises and 
institutions globally to develop scalable solutions which can be easily implemented in the rest of the 
developing and emerging economies. Simply put, Solve for India  means solve for 40% or more of the 
world. An advance d AI based solution for early diagnosis of tuberculosis (one of the top -10 causes of 
death s worldwide), for example, could easily be r olled out to countries in South East Asia or Africa, once 
developed and refined in India. Beyond healthcare, AI technologi es in the other sectors including 
agriculture, education and mobility are set to transform the world. The commonality of issues with regard 
to the above sectors across developing countries provides the ideal use case of developing AI solutions 
that could b e adapted for multiple markets. Hence, AI technologies suited for the Indian agricultural sector 
could easily be customised for other developing nations based on their local climatic conditions. 
Education continues to be a major concern in almost all devel oping countries. AI technologies that are 
capable of imparting quality education to India’s linguistically diverse population could prove very useful  
in other developing nations.  
Another aspect of India’s potential as a leader in AI is it proven track rec ord in technology solution provider 
of choice. Solved in India  (or more accurately, solved by Indian IT companies) could be the model going 
forward for Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). Indian IT companies have been pioneers in bringing 
technol ogy products and developments as solutions across the globe. As AI matures and generalised 
applications become common place, its advantage India when it comes to large scale implementation. 
Furthermore, India’s competence in IT combined with opportunities,  such as interoperability between

multiple languages, provides the much needed impetus for finding scalable solutions for problems that 
have global implications, such as NLP.   
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors 
globally, and is expected to be the key source of competitive advantage for firms.   
a) Healthcare : Application of AI in healthcare can help address issues of high barriers to access to 
healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas  that suffer from poor connectivity and limited supply 
of healthcare professionals. This can be achieved through implementation of use cases such as 
AI driven diagnostics, personali sed treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and 
imaging dia gnostics, among others.  
b) Agriculture : AI holds the promise of driving a food revolution and meeting the increased demand 
for food ( global need to produce 50% more food and cater to an additional 2 billion people by 2050 
as compared to today). It also has th e potential to address challenges such as inadequate demand 
prediction, lack of assured irrigation, and overuse  / misuse of pesticides and fertilis ers. Some use 
cases include improvement in crop yield through real time advisory, advanced detection of pest 
attacks, and prediction of crop prices to inform sowing practices.  
c) Smart Mobility, including Transports and Logistics : Potential use cases in this domain include 
autonomous fleets for ride sharing, semi -autonomous features such as driver assist, and predic tive 
engine monitoring and maintenance. Other areas that AI can impact include autonomous trucking 
and delivery, and"

Introduction
#AIforAll: Technology Leadership for Inclusive Growth

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to disrupt our world. With intelligent machines enabling high-level
cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making, coupled
with advances in data collection and aggregation, analytics and computer processing power, AI presents
opportunities to complement and supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and
work.
India, being the fastest growing economy with the second largest population in the world, has a significant
stake in the AI revolution. Recognising AI’s potential to transform economies and the need for India to
strategise its approach, Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his budget speech for 2018 – 2019, mandated NITI
Aayog to establish the National Program on AI, with a view to guiding the research and development in
new and emerging technologies. In pursuance of the above, NITI Aayog has adopted a three-pronged
approach – undertaking exploratory proof-of-concept AI projects in various areas, crafting a national
strategy for building a vibrant AI ecosystem in India and collaborating with various experts and
stakeholders. Since the start of this year, NITI Aayog has partnered with several leading AI technology
players to implement AI projects in critical areas such as agriculture and health. Learnings from these
projects, under various stages of implementation, as well as our engagement with some of the leading
institutions and experts have given a better perspective to our task of crafting the national strategy for AI,
which is the focus of this discussion paper.
This strategy document is premised on the proposition that India, given its strengths and characteristics,
has the potential to position itself among leaders on the global AI map – with a unique brand of #AIforAll.
The approach in this paper focuses on how India can leverage the transformative technologies to ensure
social and inclusive growth in line with the development philosophy of the government. In addition, India
should strive to replicate these solutions in other similarly placed developing countries.
#AIforAll will aim at enhancing and empowering human capabilities to address the challenges of access,
affordability, shortage and inconsistency of skilled expertise; effective implementation of AI initiatives to
evolve scalable solutions for emerging economies; and endeavors to tackle some of the global challenges
from AI’s perspective, be it application, research, development, technology, or responsible AI. #AIforAll
will focus on harnessing collaborations and partnerships, and aspires to ensure prosperity for all. Thus,
#AIforAll means technology leadership in AI for achieving the greater good.
While evolving the national strategy for AI, the underlying thrust was to identify applications with maximum
social impact, a willingness to learn from the best of the world when it comes to the recent technology
advancements in AI, and leveraging approaches that democratise access to and further development of
AI.
From an applications perspective, the approach is to identify sectors that may have the potential of
greatest externalities while adopting AI solutions, and hence require the government to play a leading
role in developing the implementation roadmap for AI. For example, the agriculture sector in India, which
forms the bedrock of India’s economy, needs multi-layered technology infusion and coordination amongst
several stakeholders. Efforts from private sector may neither be financially optimal nor efficient on a
standalone basis, and hence sustained government intervention to tackle the existing challenges and
constraints is needed. Hence, India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimisation
of social goods, rather than maximisation of topline growth.
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

From a technology perspective, the strategy is to maximise the late-movers’ advantage. Acknowledging
that India is some distance away from consistently delivering home grown pioneering technology
solutions in AI, adapting and innovating the technology for India’s unique needs and opportunities would
help it in leapfrogging, while simultaneously building the foundational R&D capability aimed at ensuring
competitiveness in the long run.
Solving for India, given the complexity and multi-dimensional aspects of most of our economic and
societal challenges, can easily be extended to the rest of the emerging and developing economies. An
integral part of India’s strategy for AI involves tackling common and complex global challenges that can
be solved through technology intervention, and India’s scale and opportunity landscape provides the ideal
test-bed to ensure sustainable and scalable solutions.
The purpose of this paper is to lay the groundwork for evolving the National Strategy for Artificial
Intelligence. While this paper includes several recommendations, some of which may be deemed
disruptive, specifics (e.g. execution and financial implications) have been consciously avoided, since
wider consultations and consensus building is needed to refine these recommendations. This document
is intended to serve as an “essential pre-read” in building a truly transformative approach in pursuit of
#AIforAll.

Executive Summary
India’s Approach to Leadership in AI

AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem
solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI
has evolved in ways that far exceed its original conception. With incredible advances made in data
collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a
variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. As AI’s capabilities have dramatically
expanded, so have its utility in a growing number of fields.
The truly transformative nature of the technology, yet the nascent stage of its adoption worldwide,
provides India with an opportunity to define its own brand of AI leadership. #AIforAll - the brand proposed
for India implies inclusive technology leadership, where the full potential of AI is realised in pursuance of
the country’s unique needs and aspirations. The strategy should strive to leverage AI for economic
growth, social development and inclusive growth, and finally as a “Garage” for emerging and developing
economies.
While AI has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors, adoption till date
has been driven primarily from a commercial perspective. Technology disruptions like AI are once-in-a-
generation phenomenon, and hence large-scale adoption strategies, especially national strategies, need
to strike a balance between narrow definitions of financial impact and the greater good. NITI Aayog has
decided to focus on five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs:
a) Healthcare: increased access and affordability of quality healthcare,
b) Agriculture: enhanced farmers’ income, increased farm productivity and reduction of wastage,
c) Education: improved access and quality of education,
d) Smart Cities and Infrastructure: efficient and connectivity for the burgeoning urban population, and
e) Smart Mobility and Transportation: smarter and safer modes of transportation and better traffic
and congestion problems.
To truly reap the benefits of deploying AI at scale, the report identifies the following barriers that need to
be addressed in order to achieve the goals of #AIforAll:
a) Lack of broad based expertise in research and application of AI,
b) Absence of enabling data ecosystems – access to intelligent data,
c) High resource cost and low awareness for adoption of AI,
d) Privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulations around anonymisation of data, and
e) Absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.
Superior research capabilities have been the cornerstone of leadership aspirations in emerging
technologies and effectively realising the growth potential requires expertise in both core and applied
research. Despite indications of recent positive efforts in this aspect of technology, AI research in India
is still in its infancy and requires large scale concerted and collaborative interventions.
The paper proposes a two-tiered structure to address India’s AI research aspirations:
a) Centre of Research Excellence (CORE) focused on developing better understanding of existing
core research and pushing technology frontiers through creation of new knowledge;
b) International Centers of Transformational AI (ICTAI) with a mandate of developing and deploying
application-based research. Private sector collaboration is envisioned to be a key aspect of
ICTAIs.

The research capabilities are proposed to be complemented by an umbrella organisation responsible for
providing direction to research efforts through analysis of socio-economic indicators, studying global
advancements, and encouraging international collaboration. Pursuing “moonshot research projects”
through specialised teams, development of a dedicated supranational agency to channel research in
solving big, audacious problems of AI – “CERN for AI”, and developing common computing and other
related infrastructure for AI are other key components research suggested.
As technology increasingly disrupts the nature of jobs and shifts the benchmarks of technological
aptitude, skilling and reskilling of workforce forms an integral part of our approach to adopting AI. There
is an emergent need for reskilling the existing workforce and developing future talent in accordance with
the changing needs of the job market. This could be done via the adoption of decentralised teaching
mechanisms working in collaboration with the private sector and educational institutions to prescribe
certification with value. Furthermore, promotion of job creation in new areas, like data annotation needs
to be identified and promoted, as these would have the potential of absorbing a large portion of the
workforce that may find itself redundant due to increasing automation.
Adoption of AI across the value chain viz. startups, private sector, PSUs and government entities, will
truly unlock the potential by creating a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. The barriers to AI
development and deployment can effectively be addressed by adopting the marketplace model – one
that enables market discovery of not only the price but also of different approaches that are best suited
to achieve the desired results. A three-pronged, formal marketplace could be created focusing on data
collection and aggregation, data annotation and deployable models. There could be a common platform
called the National AI Marketplace (NAIM).
Furthermore, for accelerated adoption of a highly collaborative technology like AI, the government has to
play the critical role of a catalyst in supporting partnerships, providing access to infrastructure, fostering
innovation through research and creating the demand by seeking solutions for addressing various
governmental needs.
As AI-based solutions permeate the way we live and do business, questions on ethics, privacy and
security will also emerge. Most discussions on ethical considerations of AI are a derivation of the FAT
framework (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency). A consortium of Ethics Councils at each Centre
of Research Excellence can be set up and it would be expected that all COREs adhere to standard
practice while developing AI technology and products.
Data is one of the primary drivers of AI solutions, and thus appropriate handling of data, ensuring privacy
and security is of prime importance. Challenges include data usage without consent, risk of identification
of individuals through data, data selection bias and the resulting discrimination of AI models, and
asymmetry in data aggregation. The paper suggests establishing data protection frameworks and
sectorial regulatory frameworks, and promotion of adoption of international standards.
In order for India to ride the AI innovation wave, a robust intellectual property framework is required.
Despite a number of government initiatives in strengthening the IP regime, challenges remain, especially
in respect of applying stringent and narrowly focused patent laws to AI applications – given the unique
nature of AI solution development. The importance of data to development of useful models is one such
example. To tackle these issues, establishment of IP facilitation centers to help bridge the gap between
practitioners and AI developers, and adequate training of IP granting authorities, judiciary and tribunals
is suggested.
The AI strategy is aimed at primarily guiding an inevitable wave of change for quicker and better impact.
The AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving and taking societies into uncharted territory. For now, we can begin
to ask some of the big questions that each society must answer for itself: are we ready to manage data
ethically? How do we bridge the digital divide? Which innovations are worthy of public funds and
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

partnerships? Bringing these questions into the open is the most important step in ensuring that AI
advances create a better society.
There has been tremendous activity concerning AI policy in different countries over the past couple of
years. Governments in USA, UK, France, Japan and China have released their policy and strategy papers
relating to AI. In order to establish a leadership role, it is important for India to take the plunge and start
by releasing a Strategy Paper to initiate the roll out of an ambitious programme that would ensure for
India its rightful place in this transformational era.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
A technical primer

AI might just be the single largest technology revolution of our live times, with the potential to disrupt
almost all aspects of human existence. Andrew Ng, Co-founder of Coursera and formerly head of Baidu
AI Group / Google Brain, compares the transformational impact of AI to that of electricity 100 years back.
With many industries aggressively investing in cognitive and AI solutions, global investments are forecast
to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50.1% to reach USD 57.6 billion in 20211.
AI is not a new phenomenon, with much of its theoretical and technological underpinning developed over
the past 70 years by computer scientists such as Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. AI has
already existed to some degree in many industries and governments. Now, thanks to virtually unlimited
computing power and the decreasing costs of data storage, we are on the cusp of the exponential age of
AI as organisations learn to unlock the value trapped in vast volumes of data.
AI is a constellation of technologies that enable machines to act with higher levels of intelligence and
emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act. Thus, computer vision and audio
processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and
speech. The natural language processing and inference engines can enable AI systems to analyse and
understand the information collected. An AI system can also take action through technologies such as
expert systems and inference engines or undertake actions in the physical world. These human
capabilities are augmented by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. AI
systems are finding ever-wider application to supplement these capabilities across enterprises as they
grow in sophistication.
Irrespective of the type of AI being used, however, every application begins with large amounts of training
data. In the past, this kind of performance was driven by rules-based data analytics programs, statistical
regressions, and early “expert systems.” But the explosion of powerful deep neural networks now gives
AI something a mere program doesn’t have: the ability to do the unexpected.

AI technology has experienced a checkered history of waves of optimism followed by disappointment and
periods of inertia, dubbed as “AI winters”. Each previous breakthrough has only ever partly lived up to
the hype it generated, and none has managed to kick-start the technology into the mainstream.

The big change today is that we are in an unprecedented period of technology innovation across so many
different fields that gives us the belief that the “AI Spring” has not only arrived but is here to stay. Key

a) Unlimited access to computing power: The worldwide public cloud services market is projected
to grow 21.4% in 2018 to total USD186.4 billion, up from USD153.5 billion in 2017, according to
Gartner, Inc. The access is amplified by rapid increase in computational power.
b) Huge fall in cost of storing data: We are in an age where the hard drive cost per gigabyte of data
has been falling exponentially, to the extent that we are approaching near zero marginal cost for
storing data (down from USD500,000 a gigabyte in 1980 to 2 cents a gigabyte in 2017).
c) Explosion in data that is digitised: As per IDC forecasts, by 2025, the global data sphere will grow
to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes)2, or ten times the 16.1ZB of data generated in 2016.
As Barry Smyth, Professor of Computer science at University College Dublin, says: "Data is to
AI what food is to humans." So, in a more digital world, the exponential growth of data is
constantly feeding AI improvements.
Consider, for example, the vastly increased processing power that comes from using Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) in place of Central Processing Units (CPUs). Google, in May 2017,
announced that its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) delivered 30-80 times higher performance-per-watt
than contemporary CPUs and GPUs. When you add the decreasing cost of storage to the mix, plus
the exponential growth in data volumes, together with the emergence of open source platforms and
frameworks, you have got a uniquely potent combination of technologies and capabilities. It all adds
up to a very powerful foundation to give AI its critical mass for mainstream adoption.
Box 1: Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Machine Learning, a term coined by Artur Samuel in 1959, meant “the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed.” Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms to parse data and learn from it,
and making a determination or prediction as a result. Instead of hand coding software libraries with well-
defined specific instructions for a particular task, the machine gets “trained” using large amounts of data
and algorithms, and in turn gains the capability to perform specific tasks.
“Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine Learning. Deep Learning was inspired by the
structure and function of the brain, specifically the interconnecting of many neurons. Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) are algorithms that are based on the biological structure of the brain. In ANNs, there
are ‘neurons’ which have discrete layers and connections to other “neurons”. Each layer picks out a
specific feature to learn. It’s this layering that gives deep learning its name, depth is created by using
multiple layers as opposed to a single layer3.”

For a detailed analysis of major types of Machine Learning, algorithms and use cases, please refer to
Appendix I: Artificial Intelligence Explained.
AI gets categorised in different ways and it may be useful to understand the various categories, their
rationale and the implications.
a) Weak AI vs. Strong AI: Weak AI describes "simulated" thinking. That is, a system which appears
to behave intelligently, but doesn't have any kind of consciousness about what it's doing. For
example, a chatbot might appear to hold a natural conversation, but it has no sense of who it is
or why it's talking to you. Strong AI describes "actual" thinking. That is, behaving intelligently,
thinking as human does, with a conscious, subjective mind. For example, when two humans
converse, they most likely know exactly who they are, what they're doing, and why.
b) Narrow AI vs. General AI: Narrow AI describes an AI that is limited to a single task or a set
number of tasks. For example, the capabilities of IBM's Deep Blue, the chess playing computer
that beat world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, were limited to playing chess. It wouldn't have
been able to win a game of tic-tac-toe - or even know how to play. General AI describes an AI
which can be used to complete a wide range of tasks in a wide range of environments. As such,
it's much closer to human intelligence.
c) Superintelligence: The term "superintelligence" is often used to refer to general and strong AI at
the point at which it surpasses human intelligence, if it ever does.
While big strides have been made in Artificial Narrow Intelligence – algorithms that can process
documents, drive vehicles or beat champion chess players, no one has yet claimed the first production
or development of General AI. The weight of expert opinion is that we are a long way off the emergence
of General AI.

Global Developments in Artificial Intelligence
Benchmarking select countries

Countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the potential economic and social
benefits of developing and applying AI. For example, China and U.K. estimate that 26% and 10% of their
GDPs respectively in 2030 will be sourced from AI-related activities and businesses. There has been
tremendous activity concerning AI policy positions and the development of an AI ecosystem in different
countries over the last 18 to 24 months – the US published its AI report in December 2016; France
published the AI strategy in January 2017 followed by a detailed policy document in March 2018; Japan
released a document in March 2017; China published the AI strategy in July 2017; and U.K. released its
industrial strategy in November 2017.
Infrastructural supply side interventions have been planned by various countries for creating a larger
ecosystem of AI development. Creation of “data trusts”, rolling out of digital connectivity infrastructure
such as 5G / full fiber networks, common supercomputing facilities, fiscal incentives and creation of open
source software libraries are some of the focus areas of various governments as committed in their
strategy papers.
In the area of core research in AI and related technologies, universities and research institutions from the
US, China and Japan have led the publication volume on AI research topics between 2010 and 2016.
Universities in USA, primarily Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Stanford, took an early lead in AI research by offering new courses, establishing research facilities and
instituting industry partnerships. Off late, Chinese universities, especially Peking and Tsinghua
Universities have caught on to the race by utilising large scale public funding and extensive research
partnerships with private companies.
For building the future workforce for AI, countries are also significantly increasing the allocation of
resources for Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) talent development through
investment in universities, mandating new courses (e.g., AI and law), and offering schemes to retrain
people. For instance, U.K. has planned to build over 1,000 government supported PhD researchers by
2025 and set up a Turing fellowship to support an initial cohort of AI fellows while China has launched a
five-year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000 students working on AI technologies.
Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have
instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.)
while China and Japan have allowed existing ministries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral
areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware
about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments.
National governments have significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as
increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network
and infrastructure and AI-related public procurements. China, USA, France and Japan have committed
significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption.
These countries are also leveraging different combinations of public-private-academia to develop and
promote AI. Development of technology parks, and connecting large corporations with startups and
forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are
some of the public-private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused.
AI technology development and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies
and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found that by 2022, around 46% of the workforce will be
engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically
changed skillsets4. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in
place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain
and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio-economic environment. Therefore,
the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India.
A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is placed in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy
Review.

Identifying priority areas for India’s efforts in Artificial Intelligence

A national AI strategy needs to be premised on a framework which is adapted to India’s unique needs
and aspirations, while at the same time, is capable of achieving the country’s full potential of leveraging
AI developments. Such a framework could be seen as an aggregation of the following three distinct, yet
inter-related components:
a) Opportunity: the economic impact of AI for India
b) AI for Greater Good: social development and inclusive growth
c) AI Garage for 40% of the world: solution provider of choice for the emerging and developing
economies (ex-China) across the globe

Opportunity: the economic impact of Artificial Intelligence for India
AI is emerging as a new factor of production, augmenting the traditional factors of production viz. labor,
capital and innovation and technological changes captured
in total factor productivity. AI has the potential to overcome
the physical limitations of capital and labour, and open up
new sources of value and growth. From an economic impact
perspective, AI has the potential to drive growth through
enabling: (a) intelligent automation i.e. ability to automate
complex physical world tasks that require adaptability and
agility across industries, (b) labour and capital
augmentation: enabling humans to focus on parts of their
role that add the most value, complementing human
capabilities and improving capital efficiency, and (c)
innovation diffusion i.e. propelling innovations as it diffuses through the economy. AI innovations in one
sector will have positive consequences in another, as industry sectors are interdependent based on value
chain. Economic value is expected to be created from the new goods, services and innovations that AI
will enable.
Accenture, in its recent AI research reports5, provides a framework for evaluating the economic impact
of AI for select G20 countries and estimates AI to boost India’s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage
points by 2035.

AI for Greater Good: social development and inclusive growth
Beyond just the headline numbers of economic impact, a disruptive technology such as AI needs to be
seen from the perspective of the transformative impact it could have on the greater good – improving the
quality of life and access of choice to a large section of the country. In that sense, the recent
advancements in AI seem to be custom-made for the unique opportunities and challenges that India
faces. Increased access to quality health facilities (including addressing the locational access barriers),
inclusive financial growth for large sections of population that have hitherto been excluded from formal
financial products, providing real-time advisory to farmers and help address unforeseen factors towards
increasing productivity, building smart and efficient cities and infrastructure to meet the demands of
rapidly urbanising population are some of the examples that can be most effectively solved through the
non-incremental advantages that a technology such as AI can provide.
AI Garage for 40% of the world
In addition to providing unique opportunities, India provides a perfect “playground” for enterprises and
institutions globally to develop scalable solutions which can be easily implemented in the rest of the
developing and emerging economies. Simply put, Solve for India means solve for 40% or more of the
world. An advanced AI based solution for early diagnosis of tuberculosis (one of the top-10 causes of
deaths worldwide), for example, could easily be rolled out to countries in South East Asia or Africa, once
developed and refined in India. Beyond healthcare, AI technologies in the other sectors including
agriculture, education and mobility are set to transform the world. The commonality of issues with regard
to the above sectors across developing countries provides the ideal use case of developing AI solutions
that could be adapted for multiple markets. Hence, AI technologies suited for the Indian agricultural sector
could easily be customised for other developing nations based on their local climatic conditions.
Education continues to be a major concern in almost all developing countries. AI technologies that are
capable of imparting quality education to India’s linguistically diverse population could prove very useful
in other developing nations.
Another aspect of India’s potential as a leader in AI is it proven track record in technology solution provider
of choice. Solved in India (or more accurately, solved by Indian IT companies) could be the model going
forward for Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). Indian IT companies have been pioneers in bringing
technology products and developments as solutions across the globe. As AI matures and generalised
applications become commonplace, its advantage India when it comes to large scale implementation.
Furthermore, India’s competence in IT combined with opportunities, such as interoperability between

multiple languages, provides the much needed impetus for finding scalable solutions for problems that
have global implications, such as NLP.
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors
globally, and is expected to be the key source of competitive advantage for firms.
a) Healthcare: Application of AI in healthcare can help address issues of high barriers to access to
healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas that suffer from poor connectivity and limited supply
of healthcare professionals. This can be achieved through implementation of use cases such as
AI driven diagnostics, personalised treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and
imaging diagnostics, among others.
b) Agriculture: AI holds the promise of driving a food revolution and meeting the increased demand
for food (global need to produce 50% more food and cater to an additional 2 billion people by 2050
as compared to today). It also has the potential to address challenges such as inadequate demand
prediction, lack of assured irrigation, and overuse / misuse of pesticides and fertilisers. Some use
cases include improvement in crop yield through real time advisory, advanced detection of pest
attacks, and prediction of crop prices to inform sowing practices.
c) Smart Mobility, including Transports and Logistics: Potential use cases in this domain include
autonomous fleets for ride sharing, semi-autonomous features such as driver assist, and predictive
engine monitoring and maintenance. Other areas that AI can impact include autonomous trucking
and delivery, and improved traffic management.
d) Retail: The retail sector has been one of the early adopters of AI solutions, with applications such
as improving user experience by providing personalised suggestions, preference-based browsing
and image-based product search. Other use cases include customer demand anticipation,
improved inventory management, and efficient delivery management.
e) Manufacturing: Manufacturing industry is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI
based solutions, thus enabling ‘Factory of the Future’ through flexible and adaptable technical
systems to automate processes and machinery to respond to unfamiliar or unexpected situations
by making smart decisions. Impact areas include engineering (AI for R&D efforts), supply chain
management (demand forecasting), production (AI can achieve cost reduction and increase
efficiency), maintenance (predictive maintenance and increased asset utilisation), quality
assurance (e.g. vision systems with machine learning algorithms to identify defects and deviations
in product features), and in-plant logistics and warehousing.
f) Energy: Potential use cases in the energy sector include energy system modelling and forecasting
to decrease unpredictability and increase efficiency in power balancing and usage. In renewable
energy systems, AI can enable storage of energy through intelligent grids enabled by smart meters,
and also improve the reliability and affordability of photovoltaic energy. Similar to the manufacturing
sector, AI may also be deployed for predictive maintenance of grid infrastructure.
g) Smart Cities: Integration of AI in newly developed smart cities and infrastructure could also help
meet the demands of a rapidly urbanising population and providing them with enhanced quality of
life. Potential use cases include traffic control to reduce congestion and enhanced security through
improved crowd management.
h) Education and Skilling: AI can potentially solve for quality and access issues observed in the Indian
education sector. Potential use cases include augmenting and enhancing the learning experience
through personalised learning, automating and expediting administrative tasks, and predicting the
need for student intervention to reduce dropouts or recommend vocational training.

Adoption of AI by various sectors have been influenced by, among other factors, technical and regulatory
challenges, but commercial implications has been the biggest determinant. While technical feasibility,
availability of structured data, regulatory barriers, privacy considerations, ethical issues, preference for
human relationship have all played their roles in determining the readiness of a sector for large scale AI
adoption; compelling business use cases (e.g. improved efficiency, accuracy, speed, forecasting and
accurate decision making) that lead to direct impact on revenue and profitability have been the biggest
driver for companies to pursue accelerated adoption of AI. As illustrated in McKinsey Global Institute’s AI
adoption and use survey, sectors leading the AI adoption today also intend to grow their investment in AI
the most, thus further reinforcing the varying degrees of AI adoption across sectors.
Figure 6: Current AI adoption and future AI investments by sector

It comes as no surprise that Banking and Financial Services sector has been one of the leading sectors
globally when it comes to AI adoption, and India has also seen a steep increase in AI based
implementation in recent times. Existing and potential use of Artificial Intelligence in this sector include
improved customer interaction through personalised engagement, virtual customer assistance, and
chatbots; improved processes through deployment of intelligent automation in rule based back-office
operations; development of credit scores through analysis of bank history or social media data; and fraud
analytics for proactive monitoring and prevention of various instances of fraud, money laundering,
malpractice, and the prediction of potential risks. AI in this sector has also been employed in wealth
management viz. robo-advisory, algorithmic trading and automated transactions.
Similarly, manufacturing sector, primarily automotive and assembly, has been one of the first sectors to
implement advanced robotics at scale. The manufacturing sector in India hasn’t been far behind, as
reflected in a recent study by BCG, where India was ranked 3rd in the world in AI implementation in

manufacturing, ahead of nations such as Germany, with 19% of companies in the sector already using
AI to a significant extent6.
These trends have also been reflected in the nature of investment in research in India, with private sector
initiatives such as the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI),
choosing to focus their efforts in applied research on sectors such as manufacturing analytics and
financial analytics.
Figure 6 also reveals that sectors like Healthcare and Education have quite a lot of ground to cover as
far as AI adoption is"

Introduction  
 #AIforAll: Technology Leadership for Inclusive Growth  
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to disrupt our world. With intelligent machines enabling high -level 
cognitive processes like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making, coupled 
with advances in data collection and aggregation, analytics and compute r processing power, AI presents 
opportunities to complement and supplement human intelligence and enrich the way people live and 
work.  
India, being the fastest growing economy with the second largest population in the world, has a significant 
stake in the AI revolution. Recognising AI’s potential to transform economies and the need for India to 
strategise its approach, Hon’ble Finance Minister, in his budget speech  for 2018 – 2019 , mandated NITI 
Aayog to establish the National Program on AI , with a view to guiding the research and development in 
new and emerging technologies. In pursuance of the above, NITI Aayog has ad opted a three -pronged 
approach – undertaking exploratory proof -of-concept AI projects in various areas, crafting a national 
strategy for buil ding a vibrant AI ecosystem in India and collaborating with various experts and 
stakeholders. Since the start of this year, NITI Aayog has partnered with several leading AI technology 
players to implement AI projects in critical areas such as agriculture a nd health. Learnings from these 
projects, under various stages of implementation, as well as our engagement with some of the leading 
institutions and experts have given a better perspective to our task of crafting the national strategy for AI , 
which is the  focus of this discussion paper.  
This strategy document is premised on the proposition that India, given its strengths and characteristics, 
has the potential to position itself among leader s on the global AI map – with a  unique brand of #AIforAll . 
The appr oach in this paper focuses on how India can leverage the transformative technologies to ensure 
social and inclusive growth in line with the development philosophy of the government. In addition, India 
should  strive to replicate these solutions in other sim ilarly placed developing countries .  
#AIforAll will aim at enhancing and empowering human capabilities to address the challenges of access, 
affordability, shortage and inconsistency of skilled expertise; effective implementation of AI initiatives to 
evolve  scalable s olutions for emerging economies;  and endeavors to tackle some of the global challenges 
from AI’s perspective, be it application, research, development,  technology, or responsible AI. #AIforAll 
will focus on harnessing collaborations and partners hips, and aspires to ensure prosperity for all. Thus, 
#AIforAll means technology leadership in AI for achieving the greater good.  
While evolving the national strategy for AI, the underlying thrust was to identify applications with maximum 
social impact,  a willingness to learn from the best of the world when it comes to the recen t technology 
advancements in AI,  and leveraging approaches that democrati ze access to and further development of 
AI. 
From an applications perspective, the approach is to identify sec tors that may have the potential of 
greatest externalities while adopting AI solutions, and hence require the government to play a leading 
role in developing the implementation roadmap for AI. For example, the agriculture sector in India, which 
forms the b edrock of India’s economy, needs multi -layered technology infusion and coordination amongst 
several stakeholders. Efforts from private sector may neither be financially optimal nor efficient on a 
standalone basis, and hence  sustained government interventio n to tackle the existing challenges  and 
constraints  is needed . Hence, India’s approach to implementation of AI has to be guided by optimi sation 
of social goods, rather than maximis ation of topline growth.   
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

From a technology perspective, the strategy is to maximi se the late -movers’ advantage. Acknowledging 
that India is some distance away from consistently delivering home grown pioneering technology 
solutions in AI, adapting and innovating the technology for India’s unique needs and opportunities would 
help it in leap frogging, while simultaneously building the foundational R&D capability aimed at ensuring 
competitiveness in the long run.  
Solving for India, given the complexity and multi -dimensional aspects of most of our economic and 
societal challenges, can  easily be extended to the rest of the emerging and developing economies. An 
integral part of India’s strategy for AI involves tackling common and complex global challenges that can 
be solved through technology intervention, and India’s scale and opportuni ty landscape provides the ideal 
test-bed to ensure sustainable and scalable solutions . 
The purpose of this paper is to lay the ground work for evolv ing the National Strategy for Artificial 
Intelligence . While this paper includes several recommendations, so me of which may be deemed 
disruptive, specifics (e.g. execution and financial implications) have been consciously avoided, since 
wider consultations and consensus building is needed to refine these recommendations. This document 
is intended to serve as an “essential pre -read” in building a truly transformative approach in pursuit of 
#AIforAll.

Executive S ummary  
 India’s Approach to L eadership in AI  
 
AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem 
solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI 
has evolved in ways that far exceed its orig inal conception. With incredible advances made in data 
collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a 
variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. As AI’s capabilities have dramatical ly 
expanded, so have  its utility in a growing number of fields.  
The truly transformative nature of the technology, yet the nascent stage of its adoption worldwide, 
provides India with an opportunity to define its own brand of AI leadership. #AIforAll - the brand proposed 
for India implies inclusive technology leadership, where the full potential of AI is reali sed in pursuance of 
the country’s unique needs and aspirations. The strategy should strive to leverage AI for economic 
growth, social development and inclusive growth, and finally as a “Garage” for emerging and developing 
economies.  
While AI has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors, adoption till date 
has been driven primarily from a commercial perspective . Technol ogy disruptions like AI are once -in-a-
generation phenomenon, and hence large -scale  adoption strategies, especially national strategies, need 
to strike a balance between narrow definitions of financial impact and the greater good. NITI Aayog has 
decided to focus on five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs : 
a) Healthcare: increased access and affo rdability of quality healthcare,  
b) Agriculture: enhanced farmers’ income, increased farm produc tivity and reduction of wasta ge, 
c) Education: improved access and quality of education,  
d) Smart Cities and Infrastructure: efficient and connectivity for the burgeoning urban population,  
and 
e) Smart Mobility and Transportation: smarter and safer modes of transportation and better traffic 
and congestion problems.  
To truly reap the benefits of deploying AI at scale, the report identifies the following barriers that need to 
be addressed in order to achieve the goals of #AIforAll:  
a) Lack of broad based expertise in research and application of AI,  
b) Absence of enabling data ecosystems – access to intelligen t data,  
c) High resource cost and l ow awareness for adoption of AI,  
d) Privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulatio ns around anonymis ation of data,  and 
e) Absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.  
Superior research capabilities have  been the cornerstone of leadership aspirations in emerging 
technologies and effectively realis ing the growth potential requires expertise in both core and applied 
research. Despite indicat ions of recent positive efforts in this aspect of technology, AI research in India 
is still in its infancy and requires large scale concerted and collaborative interventions .  
The paper proposes a two -tiered structure to address India’s AI research aspirat ions:  
a) Centre  of Research Excellence (CORE)  focused on developing better understanding of existing 
core research and pushing technology frontiers through creation of new knowledge;  
b) International Centers of Transformational AI (ICTAI)  with a mandate of developing and deploying 
application -based research. Private sector collaboration is envisioned to be a key aspect of 
ICTAIs.   
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

The research capabilities are proposed to be com plemented by an umbrella organis ation responsible for 
providing  direction to research efforts through analysis of socio -economic indicators, studying global 
advancements, and encouraging international collaboration. Pursuing “ moonshot research projects ” 
through speciali sed teams, development of a dedicated supranation al agency to channel research in 
solving big, audacious  problems of AI – “CERN for AI”, and developing common computing and other 
related infrastructure for AI are other key components research suggested .  
As technology increasingly disrupts the nature of jobs and shifts the benchmarks of technological 
aptitude, skilling and reskilling of workforce forms an integral part of our approach to adopting AI. There 
is an emergent need for reskilling the existing workforce and developing future talent in accordance  with 
the changing needs of the job market. This could be done via the adoption of decentrali sed teaching 
mechanisms working in collaboration with the private sector and educational institutions to prescribe 
certification with value. Furthermore, promotion  of job creation in new areas, like data annotation needs 
to be identified and promoted, as these would have the potential of absorbing a large portion of the 
workforce that may find itself redundant due to increasing automation.  
Adoption of AI across the  value chain viz. startups, private sector, PSUs and government entities, will 
truly unlock the potential by creating a virtuous cycle of supply and demand. The barriers to AI 
development and deployment can effectively be addressed by adopting the marketpl ace model – one 
that enables market discovery of not only the price but also of different approaches that are best suited 
to achieve the desired results. A three -pronged, formal marketplace could be created focusing on data 
collection and aggregation, data  annotation and deployable models. There could be a common platform 
called the National AI Marketplace (NAIM).  
Furthermore, for accelerated adoption of a highly collaborative technology like AI, the government has to 
play the critical role of a catalyst in  supporting partnerships, providing access to infrastructure, fostering 
innovation through research and creating the demand by seeking solutions for addressing various 
governmental  needs . 
As AI -based solutions permeate the way we live and do business, questions on ethics , privacy and 
security  will also emerge . Most discussions on ethical considerations of AI are a derivation of the FAT 
framework (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency). A consortium of Ethics Councils at each Centre  
of Research Excel lence can be set up and it would be expected that all COREs adhere to standard 
practice while developing AI technology and products.  
Data is one of the primary drivers of AI solutions, and thus appropriate handling of data, ensuring privacy 
and security is  of prime importance. Challenges include data usage without consent, risk of identification 
of individuals through data, data selection bias and the resulting discrimination of AI models, and 
asymmetry in data aggregation. The paper suggests establishing d ata protection frameworks and 
sectorial regulatory frameworks, and promotion of adopti on of international standards.  
In order for India to ride the AI innovation wave, a robust intellectual property framework is required. 
Despite a number of government in itiatives in strengthening the IP regime, challenges remain, especially 
in respect of applying stringent and narrowly focused patent laws to AI applications – given the unique 
nature of AI solution development. The importance of data to development of usef ul models is one such 
example. To tackle these issues, establishment of IP facilitation centers to help bridge the gap between 
practitioners and AI developers, and adequate training of IP granting authorities, judiciary and tribunals 
is suggested.  
The AI s trategy is aimed at primarily guiding an inevitable wave of change for quicker and better impact. 
The AI ecosystem is rapidly evolving and taking societies into uncharted territory. For now, we can begin 
to ask some of the big questions that each society m ust answer for itself: are we ready to manage data 
ethically? How do we bridge the digital divide? Which innovations are worthy of public funds and  
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

partnerships? Bringing these questions into the open is the most important step in ensuring that AI 
advances  create a better society.  
There has been tremendous activity concerning AI policy in different countries over the past couple of 
years. Governments in USA, UK, France, Japan and China have released their policy and strategy papers 
relating to AI. In order to establish a leadership role, it is important for India to take the plunge and start 
by releasing a Strategy Paper to initiate the roll out of an ambitious programme that would ensure for 
India its rightful place in this transformational era.

 What is Artificial Intelligence?  
 A technical primer  
 
AI might just be the single largest technology revolution of our live times, with the potential to disrupt 
almost all aspects of human existence. Andrew Ng, Co -founder of Coursera and formerly head of Baidu 
AI Group  / Google Brain, compares the transformational impact of AI to that of electr icity 100 years back. 
With many industries aggressively investing in cognitive and AI solutions, global investments are forecast 
to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50 .1% to reach USD 57.6 billion in 20211. 
AI is not a new phenomenon, with mu ch of its theoretical and technological underpinning developed over 
the past 70 years by computer scientists such as Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. AI has 
already existed to some degree in many industries and governments. Now, thanks to virt ually unlimited 
computing power and the decreasing costs of data storage, we are on the cusp of the exponential age of 
AI as organis ations learn to unlock the value trapped in vast volumes of data.  
AI is a constellation of technologies that enable machines  to act with higher levels of intelligence and 
emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act. Thus, comput er vision and audio 
processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and 
speech. The nat ural language processing and inference engines can enable AI systems to analy se and 
understand the information collected. An AI system can also take action through technologies such as 
expert systems and inference engines or  undertak e actions in the physic al world . These  human 
capabilities are augmented  by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapt ing over time. AI 
systems are finding ever -wider application to supplement these capabilities across enterprises as they 
grow in sophistication.  
Irrespective of the type of AI being used, however, every application begins with large amounts of training 
data. In the past, this kind of performance was driven by rules -based data analytics programs, statistical 
regressions, and early “expert systems.” But the explosion of powerful de ep neural networks now gives 
AI something a mere program doesn’t have: the ability to do the unexpected.

Figure 1: What is Artificial Intelligence  
 
 
AI technology has experienced a checkered history of waves of optimism followed by disappointment and  
periods of inertia, dubbed as “ AI winters ”. Each previous breakthrough has only ever partly lived up to 
the hype it generated, and none has managed to kick -start the technology into the mainstream . 
Figure  2: Evolution of AI  
 
 
The big change today is that we are  in an unprecedented period of technology innovation across so many 
different fields tha t gives us the belief that the “ AI Spring ” has not only arrived but is here to stay. Key 
developments responsible for this optimism are :

a) Unlimited access to computing power : The worldwide public cloud services market is projected 
to grow 21.4% in 2018 to total USD186.4 billion, up from USD153.5 bi llion in 2017, according to 
Gartner, Inc. The access is amplified by rapid increase in computational power.   
b) Huge fall in cost of storing data : We are in an age where the hard drive cost per gigabyte of data 
has been falling exponentially, to the extent th at we are approaching near zero marginal cost for 
storin g data (down from USD500,000  a gigabyte in 1980 to 2 cents a gigabyte in 2017).  
c) Explosion in data that is digiti sed: As per IDC forecasts,  by 2025 , the global data sphere will grow 
to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes)2, or ten times the 16.1ZB of data generated in 2016. 
As Barry Smyth, Professor of Computer science at University College Dublin, says: "Data is to 
AI what food is to humans. " So, in a more digital world, the exponential growth of data is 
constantly feeding AI improvements . 
Consider, for example, the vastly increased processing power that comes from using Graphics 
Processing Units (GPUs) in place of Central Processing Units (C PUs). Google , in May 2017 , 
announced that its  Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) delivered  30-80 times higher performance -per-watt 
than contemporary CPUs and GPUs.  When you add the decreasing cost of storage to the mix, plus 
the exponential growth in data volume s, together with the emergence of open source platforms and 
frameworks, you have got a uniquely potent combination of technologies and capabilities. It all adds 
up to a very powerful foundation to give AI its critical mass for mainstream adoption . 
Box 1: Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
Machine Learning, a term coined by Artur Samuel in 1959, meant “the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed.” Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms to parse data and learn from it, 
and making a determination or prediction as a result. Instead of hand coding software libraries with well -
defined specific instructions for a particular task, the machine gets “trained” using large amounts of data 
and algorithms, and in turn gains the capability to per form specific tasks . 
“Deep Learning is a technique for implementing Machine L earning. Deep L earning was inspired by the 
structure and function of the brain, specifically the interconnecting of many neurons. Artificial Neural 
Networks (ANNs) are algorithms that are based on the biological structure of  the brain. In ANNs, there 
are ‘neurons’  which have discrete layers and connections to other “neurons”. Each layer picks out a 
specific feature to learn. It’s this layering that gives deep learning its name, dep th is created by using 
multiple layers as opposed to a single layer3.”

Appendix I: Artificial Intelligence Explained . 
AI gets categori sed in different ways and it may be useful to understand the various categories, their 
rationale and the implications.  
a) Weak AI vs. Strong AI : Weak AI describes "simulated" thinking. That is, a system which appears 
to behave intelligently, but doesn't have any kind of consciousness about what it's doing. For 
example, a chatbot might appear to hold a natural conversation, but it has no sense of who it is 
or why it's talking to you. Strong AI describes "actual" thinking.  That is, behaving intelligently, 
thinking as human does, with a conscious, subjective mind. For example, when two humans 
converse, they most likely know exactly who they are, what they're doing, and why.  
b) Narrow AI vs. General AI : Narrow AI describes an AI  that is limited to a single task or a set 
number of tasks. For example, the capabilities of IBM's Deep Blue, the chess playing computer 
that beat world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, were limited to playing chess. It wouldn't have 
been able to win a game  of tic -tac-toe - or even know how to play. General AI describes an AI 
which can be used to complete a wide range of tasks in a wide range of environments. As such, 
it's much closer to human intelligence.  
c) Superintelligence: The term "superintelligence" is often used to refer to general and strong AI at 
the point at which it surpasses human intelligence, if it ever does.  
While big strides have been made in Artificial Narrow Intelligence – algorithms that can process 
documents, drive vehicles or beat champion  chess players, no one has yet claimed the first production 
or development of General AI. The weight of expert opinion is that we are a long way off the emergence 
of General AI.

 Global Developments in Artificial Intelligence  
Benchmarking s elect countries  
 
Countries around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the potential economic and social 
benefits of developing and applying AI. For example, China and U.K. estimate that 26% an d 10% of their 
GDPs respectively in 2030 will be sourced from AI -related activities and businesses. There has been 
tremendous activity concerning AI policy positions and the development of an AI ecosystem in different 
countries over the last 18 to 24 month s – the US published its AI report in December 2016; France 
published the AI strategy in January 2017 followed by a detail ed policy document in March 2018 ; Japan 
released a document in March 2017; China published the AI strategy in July 2017; and U.K. rele ased its 
industrial strategy in November 2017.  
Infrastructural supply side interventions have been planned by various countries for creating a larger 
ecosystem of AI development. Creation of “data trusts”, rolling out of digital connectivity infrastructur e 
such as 5G / full fiber networks, common supercomputing facilities, fiscal incentives and creation of open 
source software libraries are some of the focus areas of various governments as committed in their 
strategy papers.  
In the area of core research i n AI and related technologies, universities and research institutions from the 
US, China and Japan have led the publication volume on AI research topics between 2010 and 2016. 
Universities in USA, primarily Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institu te of Technology and 
Stanford, took an early lead in AI research by offering new courses, establishing research facilities and 
instituting industry partnerships. Off late, Chinese universities, especi ally Peking and Tsinghua 
Universities have caught on to the race by utilising large scale public funding and extensive research 
partnerships with private companies.  
For building the future workforce for AI, countries are also significantly increasing the allocation of 
resources for Science, Technology, Enginee ring and M aths (STEM) talent development through 
investment in universities, mandating new courses (e.g., AI and law), and offering schemes to retrain 
people. For instance, U.K. has planned to build over 1,000 government supported PhD researchers by 
2025 a nd set up a Turing fellowship to support an initial cohort of AI fellows while China has launched a 
five-year university program to train at least 500 teachers and 5,000 students working on AI technologies.  
Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have 
instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.) 
while China and Japan have allowed existing minist ries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral 
areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware 
about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments.  
National governments h ave significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as 
increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network 
and infrastructure and AI -related public procurements. China, USA, Franc e and Japan have committed 
significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption.  
These countries are also leveraging different combinations of public -private -academia to develop and 
promote AI. Development of technology parks, and connec ting large corporations with start ups and  
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence

forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are 
some of the public -private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused.  
AI technology dev elopment and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies 
and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found  that by 2022, around 46%  of the workforce will be 
engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically 
changed skillsets4. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in 
place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain 
and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio -economic environment. Therefore, 
the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India.  
A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is pl aced in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy 
Review .

 Artificial  Intelligence  and India  
Identifying priority areas for India’s efforts in Artificial Intelligence  
 
A national AI strategy needs to be premised on a framework which is adapted to India’ s unique needs 
and aspirations, while at the same time, is capable of achieving the country’s full potential of leveraging 
AI developments. Such a framework could be seen as an aggregation of the following three distinct, yet 
inter-related components:  
a) Oppo rtunity : the economic impact of AI for India  
b) AI for Greater Good : social development and inclusive growth  
c) AI Garage for 40% of the world : solution provider of choice for the emerging and developing 
economies (ex -China) across the globe   
Opportunity: the economic impact of Artificial Intelligence for India  
AI is emerging as a new factor of production, augmenting the traditional factors of production viz. labor, 
capital and innovation and technological changes captured 
in total factor productivity. AI has the potential to overcome 
the physical limitations of capital and labour, and open up 
new sources of value and growth. From an economic impact 
perspective, AI has the potential to drive growth through 
enabling: (a) intelligent automation i.e. ability to au tomate 
complex physical world tasks that require adaptability and 
agility across industries, (b) labo ur and capital 
augmentation: enabling humans to focus on parts of their 
role that add the most value, complementing human 
capabilities and improving capita l efficiency, and (c) 
innovation diffusion i.e. propelling innovations as it diffuses through the economy. AI innovations in one 
sector will have positive consequences in another, as industry sectors are interdependent based on value 
chain. Economic value is expected to be created from the new goods, services and innovations that AI 
will enable.  
Accenture, in its recent AI research reports5, provides a framework for evaluating the economic impact 
of AI for select G20 countries and estimates AI to boost Indi a’s annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage 
points by 2035.

Figure 5: Unlocking innovation through AI  
 
AI for Greater Good: social development and inclusive growth  
Beyond just the headline numbers of economic impact, a disruptive technology such as AI needs to be 
seen from the perspective of the transformative impact it could have on the greater good – improving the 
quality of life and access of choice to a large section of the country. In that sense, the recent 
advancements in AI seem to be custom -made for the unique opportunities and challenges that India 
faces. Increased access to quality health facilities (including addressing the locational access barriers), 
inclusive financial growth for large sections of population that have hitherto been excluded  from formal 
financial products,  providing real -time advisory to farmers and help address unforeseen factors towards 
increasing productivity, building smart and efficient cities and infrastructure to meet the demands of 
rapidly urbani sing population are some of the examples that can be most effectively solved through the 
non-incremental advantages that a technology such as AI can provide . 
AI Garage for 40% of the world  
In addition to providing unique opportuni ties, India provides a per fect “ playground ” for enterprises and 
institutions globally to develop scalable solutions which can be easily implemented in the rest of the 
developing and emerging economies. Simply put, Solve for India  means solve for 40% or more of the 
world. An advance d AI based solution for early diagnosis of tuberculosis (one of the top -10 causes of 
death s worldwide), for example, could easily be r olled out to countries in South East Asia or Africa, once 
developed and refined in India. Beyond healthcare, AI technologi es in the other sectors including 
agriculture, education and mobility are set to transform the world. The commonality of issues with regard 
to the above sectors across developing countries provides the ideal use case of developing AI solutions 
that could b e adapted for multiple markets. Hence, AI technologies suited for the Indian agricultural sector 
could easily be customised for other developing nations based on their local climatic conditions. 
Education continues to be a major concern in almost all devel oping countries. AI technologies that are 
capable of imparting quality education to India’s linguistically diverse population could prove very useful  
in other developing nations.  
Another aspect of India’s potential as a leader in AI is it proven track rec ord in technology solution provider 
of choice. Solved in India  (or more accurately, solved by Indian IT companies) could be the model going 
forward for Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS). Indian IT companies have been pioneers in bringing 
technol ogy products and developments as solutions across the globe. As AI matures and generalised 
applications become common place, its advantage India when it comes to large scale implementation. 
Furthermore, India’s competence in IT combined with opportunities,  such as interoperability between

multiple languages, provides the much needed impetus for finding scalable solutions for problems that 
have global implications, such as NLP.   
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to provide large incremental value to a wide range of sectors 
globally, and is expected to be the key source of competitive advantage for firms.   
a) Healthcare : Application of AI in healthcare can help address issues of high barriers to access to 
healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas  that suffer from poor connectivity and limited supply 
of healthcare professionals. This can be achieved through implementation of use cases such as 
AI driven diagnostics, personali sed treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and 
imaging dia gnostics, among others.  
b) Agriculture : AI holds the promise of driving a food revolution and meeting the increased demand 
for food ( global need to produce 50% more food and cater to an additional 2 billion people by 2050 
as compared to today). It also has th e potential to address challenges such as inadequate demand 
prediction, lack of assured irrigation, and overuse  / misuse of pesticides and fertilis ers. Some use 
cases include improvement in crop yield through real time advisory, advanced detection of pest 
attacks, and prediction of crop prices to inform sowing practices.  
c) Smart Mobility, including Transports and Logistics : Potential use cases in this domain include 
autonomous fleets for ride sharing, semi -autonomous features such as driver assist, and predic tive 
engine monitoring and maintenance. Other areas that AI"

Prediction of risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules
Use Case Code : ONCO_THYR
Use Case Description:
Thyroid nodules may be present in 30-40% of the general population. Majority of these nodules are benign, but in 5-10% cases these may be malignant. Generally, benign nodules don’t need any intervention. We generally judge whether a nodule is benign or malignant based upon USG and FNAC findings. Molecular tests have also come up in this domain. Still, we end up operating upon a large number of cases who eventually turn out to be benign. These are the patients who could have potentially avoided surgery. There is a need to be able to find out which nodules are at higher risk of malignancy. We want an AI based tool to predict risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules using clinical details (age, gender, etc), fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and ultrasounf (USG) features
Expected Outcomes – Deliverables:
Better risk prediction of malignancy in thyroid nodules. This will help avoid surgery in many benign cases.
Any other inputs:
FNAC slides will need digitalization

Prediction of risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules
Use Case Code : ONCO_THYR
Use Case Description:
Thyroid nodules may be present in 30-40% of the general population. Majority of these nodules are benign, but in 5-10% cases these may be malignant. Generally, benign nodules don’t need any intervention. We generally judge whether a nodule is benign or malignant based upon USG and FNAC findings. Molecular tests have also come up in this domain. Still, we end up operating upon a large number of cases who eventually turn out to be benign. These are the patients who could have potentially avoided surgery. There is a need to be able to find out which nodules are at higher risk of malignancy. We want an AI based tool to predict risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules using clinical details (age, gender, etc), fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and ultrasounf (USG) features
Expected Outcomes – Deliverables:
Better risk prediction of malignancy in thyroid nodules. This will help avoid surgery in many benign cases.
Any other inputs:
FNAC slides will need digitalization

Prediction of chemotherapy drug toxicity
Use Case Code : ONCO_DRG
Use Case Description:
Chemotherepeutic agents act against the rapidly dividing cancer cells. As collateral damage happens, the patients develop several side effects. Such side effects may vary from nausea, vomiting to a major cardiac event. Based upon the exisitng knowledge from published scientific literature, we try to pre-empt such toxicities. This may mean not giving a particular drug, or decreasing dosage or starting other medicines emperically to counter the effects. There is merit in being able to evaluate these effects, not only rare catastrophic ones but also routine ones with higher grades. We want to evaluate if AI can predict such toxicities to various chemotherepeutic drugs.
Expected Outcomes – Deliverables:
Prediction of grade 3/4 toxicities related to commonly used drugs to treat various cancers. Input variables will include clinical and demographic data, co-morbidites, various labarotary parameters
Any other inputs:
Before proceeding we can discuss about the drugs we would like to cover.
